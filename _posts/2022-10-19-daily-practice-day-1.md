I’ve recently decided to re-dedicate myself to a skincare routine, and as part of that research I found myself in a rabbit hole learning about sunscreen. As an avid sunscreen user, I was surprised to realize how little I know about how sunscreen. For this project, I’m planning to focus on sunscreen in general, and am aiming to find a critical view point as I continue my research. One thought to focus on is to investigate the different rating systems that are used to measure the ability of the sunscreen to block UVA rays. In the US, we generally just see SPF ratings on our sunscreen, which I believe is only measuring how effective the sunscreen is at blocking UVB rays, without any mention of UVA rays explicitly.

For my first day of making I drew some diagrams while I read an article about how sunscreen actually works. I’m planning to continue this sort of process this week of drawing diagrams or system diagrams based on research resources that I’m reading.
