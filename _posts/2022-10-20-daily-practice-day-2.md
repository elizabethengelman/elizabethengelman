Today I began reading a journal article, [Sunscreens and Photoaging: A Review of Current Literatures](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40257-021-00632-5), which touched a bit on the different wave lengths of light on the Electromagnetic Spectrum. I realized a few connections that this topic has to previous interested of mine in the past, which is kind of cool – it’s seem there is an underlying theme that I hadn’t realized.

- Over the summer, I had a general idea of focusing some of my work on invisible forces, or things that effect our lives but can’t necessarily be seen or experienced in a tangible way. By focusing my research on sunscreen, I unintentionally am choosing to focus on screening another invisible force!
- At my first job as a software engineer, the company’s name referenced infrared light, and the intention was to emulate a force that is strong but can’t necessarily be seen or felt. I loved this association, and here am I looking at light rays again!


From that article, I was really interested in getting to compare the wavelengths of rays that are visible vs ones that are not. And seeing which wavelengths are harmful vs ones that are helpful. It’s such a small difference in the length of a light ray that can change it into something really dangerous.

Updating to add some [notes](https://www.figma.com/file/V7SJWS0cVWiBcIhvkhuP29/Daily-Practice-2?node-id=0%3A1) I took while reading the article and to provide some further explanation of the image above. The color spectrum + the gray on either sides is illustration the different wave types, in order of their wavelengths, from smallest to largest. The blue is sunscreen – I’ve been playing around with the idea of what it would be like if in the future, fashion evolved to valued brightly pigmented face makeup with sunscreen properties. I don’t think that this future is that far off, and am interested to dig more into that line of thought. And the pink circles are the skin, with different rays effecting different parts of the skin layers.
