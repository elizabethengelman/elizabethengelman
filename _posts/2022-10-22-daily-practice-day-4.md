For today’s daily practice, I wanted to push myself to do something less digital. Something that has always perplexed and frustrated me about sunscreen is how imperfect it is. I have a family history of skin cancer, and have struggled with skin damage myself. It’s discouraging to drench myself in sunscreen and still get burned, so I was playing with that idea. In the last painting, I’m poking fun at that a bit by envisioning that the whole world of the character is covered in sunscreen, and they still get burned. How do we enjoy the outdoors without risking our health?

I’m also including a photo of myself at the beach this past summer because I find it amusing, and it was partially my inspiration for today’s practice. Completely covered by several layers of sunscreen, a long sleeve shirt, a hat, a towel, just to enjoy being outside.
