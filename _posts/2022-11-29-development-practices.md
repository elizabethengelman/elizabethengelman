## Ideas from in-class workshops
### First description of idea:
Sunscreen: I’ve recently learned a bit more about UVA vs UVB rays, and how sunscreens in the US seem to only be required to put the SPF rating on the products which is specific to blocking UVB rays. In other countries the UVA rating is put on more products, but the way that rating is captured isn’t standardized yet.

### Refining the idea
**Topic:** Sunscreen’s ability to block UVA and UVB rays

**Systems Map(s):**

- it may be interesting to work through a feedback loop of sorts to understand how sunscreen filters even work (i.e. when the ray hits the filter it breaks down, so that is why we need to reapply sunscreen periodically)
- map of the process of regulation/approval of different ingredients. i.e. how does the FDA approve a particular ingredient?


**Stakeholders:** all humans, companies that make the sunscreen, governments that potentially regulate sunscreen, environmentalists (chemical filters are detrimental to the environment), dermatologists

**Critical Analysis:** There are a few critical view points that have come up with some really preliminary research, and I’m not sure which is the best to focus on yet:

- some filters used in sunscreens are very good at blocking rays, but bad for the environment, and/or could be bad for humans in other ways (hormone disruptors, etc). Some people think that the potential health risks of these ingredients is worth the risk because we know that UVA and UVB rays are harmful. Is it worth the risk to the environment too?
- There is a convenience/cosmetic component to this: mineral filters (non-chemical) aren’t bad for the environment or humans (I think), but they are more annoying to apply, create a white cast on the skin which people do not want, may not have the staying power of chemical blockers, etc.
