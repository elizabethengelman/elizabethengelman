<!-- This is weird, but I was having issues with rendering markdown in an html file with include. I want to do this because I wanted to wrap the intro & skills in a div, and the rest in a div so I can create a side bar look.

There is a way to have a sidebar with the Minimal Mistakes theme including the site author information. When I did that, it rendered nicely on screen but would not include the sidebar in the print version. I am sure there is a way to undo some of the `@media print` css styles in the theme to get this to work, but I thought that it would likely be quicker, and easier to understand if I just rolled this page from scratch, outside of the theme. -->
